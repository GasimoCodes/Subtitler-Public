# Welcome to **Subtitler** docs!
Subtitler is a simple to use Subtitling/Closed-Captions solution for Unity3D inspired by Source Engines implementation. Its currently under active development. Although the system itself is completely usable, the Editor authoring tools are undergoing a recode and may not work as expected.

## Quick Start:
1. Clone the repository
2. import **com.gasimo.subtitler** folder into your Packages using [Package Manager](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui.html) (this will automatically include dependencies)
3. If you dont have [DOTween](https://dotween.demigiant.com/download.php) in your project, import it or copy the 'Dependencies' folder from cloned repo (*Assets/Dependencies*) into your project. 
4. To see samples, open Package Manager, navigate to Subtitler. Go into **Samples** tab and select import. Sample will automatically import into *Assets/Samples/Subtitler*
