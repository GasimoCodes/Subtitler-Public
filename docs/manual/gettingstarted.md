# Welcome to **Subtitler** docs!

Subtitler is a simple to use Subtitling/Closed-Captions solution for Unity3D. Its currently under active development but is completely usable. Report all bugs or feature requests [here](https://github.com/GasimoCodes/Subtitler/issues/new/choose).


## Quick Start:
Recommended Unity version (as of now) is 2023.3 due to a [bug in UIToolkit](https://forum.unity.com/threads/cant-bind-multicolumnlistview-to-property.1425945/), which is yet to be backported. Minimum supported version is 2022, but it doesnt feature custom editor for easier subtitle editing. 

### UPM:

# [2022.2 and above](#tab/newer)
